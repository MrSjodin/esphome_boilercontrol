# Control a boiler with effect block inputs
Collection of files and information on how to control effect blocking of a boiler that has external input for effect blocking.

The ESPhome will add *select.effect_block_level* to Home Assistant with the options:

 - None - means that no relay is active
 - A - means that relay A is active and relay B is inactive
 - B - means that relay A is inactive and relay B is active
 - A+B - means that both relay A and relay B are active

| File | Description |
